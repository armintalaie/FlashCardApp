## Flashcards app

what this app can do:

- make decks to store cards
- add new cards to deck (front and back)
- sort cards
- filter cards
- search through cards
- move/delete/copy decks or cards


An example of text with **bold** and *italic* fonts.  Note that the IntelliJ markdown previewer doesn't seem to render 
the bold and italic fonts correctly but they will appear correctly on GitHub.
