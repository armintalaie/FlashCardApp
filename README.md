#Flight Tickets Buying App 

**What will the application do?**
- List of Users
- Make user accounts
- List of Flights
- User can buy tickets
    - find specific flights
    - add to cart -> checkout
    - get points for buying
    - return flight ticket(s)
    - buy multiple seats
- List of Airlines
- Rewards system for purchasing tickets
- Airlines, Users and Flights will have features that will make this app more 
interesting


**Who will use it:**
1. people who want to purchase flight tickets
2. companies to sell flight tickets *(Administrator perspective)*

**Why is this project of interest to you?**
I have passion for travelling and I've seen many websites selling tickets online;
some very good and some very basic. 
<br> I think handling a large consumer base that
will require a good strategy to handle the tickets and payment efficiently.
